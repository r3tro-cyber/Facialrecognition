This Python script is all about recognizing faces using a cool combo of eigenfaces and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It fetches facial data, shrinks it down with PCA, trains an SVM to recognize faces, and then shows off how well it did. You'll see metrics like precision and recall for each recognized face. Plus, it visualizes the eigenfaces learned from the data. It's a fun way to dive into facial recognition with Python!
